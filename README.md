# Bird Detection Specific

## Project Overview 
The Bird Detection Project aims to create an automated system that identifies and monitors birds in real-time using a Raspberry Pi, camera, and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The system captures images of birds, processes them to detect and identify bird species, and displays the results on a dedicated website. This project combines hardware and software components to create a robust and interactive bird monitoring system.

# Raspberry Pi:

Acts as the central processing unit for the project.
Manages the camera module and runs the ML models for bird detection.
Handles data transmission to the web server for displaying results.
Camera Module:

# A high-definition camera connected to the Raspberry Pi.
Captures images of birds in various environments (e.g., backyard, park).
Configurable settings for optimal image capture based on lighting and weather conditions.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

# Pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Models trained on large datasets of bird images to accurately identify different bird species.
Python libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for running the ML models on the Raspberry Pi.
Web Interface:

# A user-friendly website that displays bird detection results in real-time.
Features include a live feed from the camera, a gallery of detected birds, and statistical data (e.g., species count, detection times).
Built using web development frameworks Tomcat Server for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end.
